## SecretSantaGenerator
This secret Santa generator uses a hashmap to keep track of who is allowed to draw who. The key is the drawn name and the value is a black list of people that they are not allowed to be assigned to. Created using Python. 

#### Running
Use a computer to run this. Change the names in the HashMap and the Drawn List to fit your needs. Once done, click run on your editor or use the command line:

```bash 
$ python main.py
```
